# nntm - No Nonsense Todo Manager

Interactive terminal todo manager.

Supports:

- context (grouping by `@type` and viewing them separately),
- priority (A-Z),
- dates (addition and completion),
- toggling between un/completed,
- and sorting (priority, date),
- grouping by un/completed,

## Motivation

## Ordinary todo manager

I use the Android app _Markor_ for my todos on my phone, and it uses a very simple and straight forward format. As my phone is synced with my computer via _Syncthing-fork_, I thought of writing this software to be able to handle the same todo file also on the computer. I wanted a simple way to manage my todos in the terminal, and this is what I came up with.

This todo manager being compatible with _Markor_, does not prevent you from using it without _Markor_. All data is stored in a very simple text file.

## Real time logg viewer for everything

`nntm` accepts streaming input by unix domain socket. Thus, this todo manager can be used as a real time log viewer for anything. It is not limited to todo files, but can be used to view any input sent to it in real time.

For example: When developing plugins for Neovim, I send all debug messages and diagnostics to an external loggsystem, and `nntm` works for that purpose. [nntmwrite](https://github.com/fmxsh/nntmwrite) is a small plugin for `Neovim` I use for that purpose. It connects to the unix domain socket and sends messages to it, which are then displayed in `nntm` in real time. `nntm` in turn is integrated into my `Neovim` so I can easily toggle it. Thus, with this solution, the same interface for navigating todos apply to navigating the log messages.

## Modes

`nntm` has two modes of operation:

1. **Ordinary todo file**: You can use it to manage your todos in a plain text file, similar to how _Markor_ does it.
2. **Unix domain socket**: You can use it to view real time logs or any other streaming input by connecting to a unix domain socket.

The format of the input is the same for both modes.

Several `nntm` instances can run simultaneously on the same _ordinary todo file_ or _unix domain socket_. In case of the former I'm not sure it updates across instances if the file changes. In case of the latter, it works as expected, and all instances will receive the same input in real time, however, any action on the input (sorting, marking, etc, wont replicate, and probably shouldn't).

Read the section `Motivation` above for more details on these modes.

## Usage

### Ordinary todo file

```
nntm <todo-file> [--exec /path/to/script.sh]
```

- `todo-file`: Path to your plain text todo list.
- `--exec`: _(optional)_ Script to run when adding or completing todos.

Use keyboard shortcuts to navigate, add, complete, sort, or archive tasks. Press `?` inside the viewer to see all available keys (see section _Interface_ below).

Example:

```
nntm ~/tasks/todo.txt --exec ~/hooks/notify.sh
```

### Unix domain socket

`nntm` can connect to a UNIX domain socket and act as a **real-time log viewer**. The socket is one managed by a separate daemon, `nntmd` which is included in this project.

Several `nntm` clients, or other clients can connect to the same socket and receive the same input in real time.

Interacting with the real time content will not propagate across the other connected clinets, for example if a line is marked. (And no such feature has been planned.)

The `nntmd` daemon currently listens on `/tmp/nntm-stream` by default. (TODO: No option to set it yet).

**Option:** The daemon supports `-v` for verbose output, otherwise it is silent by default.

```
# Start the daemon
nntmd
```

```
# Start the viewer
nntm /tmp/nntm-stream
```

And optionally:

```
# Send a test message
echo "@debug connected to project" | socat - UNIX-CONNECT:/tmp/nntm-stream
```

> [!NOTE]
> The writer to the Unix Domain Socket just writes the desired data. The reader identifies as `READER` by first sending `READER\n`, That is: the ASCII characters R, E, A, D, E, R, followed by a newline (\n). After sending this, the server (`nntmd`) responds with: `OK\n`.

## Interface

### üîç Navigation

| Key | Action                               | Notes                                 |
| --- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| `j` | Move down                            | Navigate to next visible item         |
| `k` | Move up                              | Navigate to previous visible item     |
| `h` | Switch to previous context (`@type`) | Cycles backward through types         |
| `l` | Switch to next context (`@type`)     | Cycles forward through types          |
| `@` | Jump to context                      | Prompts for `@type` name to switch to |

When switching to context using `@`, if no todos exist in that context, the list will be empty. You can add a new todo using `n` to create a new todo in that context.

### ‚úÖ Task Management

| Key     | Action                                   | Notes                              |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `SPACE` | Toggle completed state                   | Marks/unmarks task as complete     |
| `s`     | Set or clear priority (on selected item) | Skips completed items              |
| `t`     | Change type (context) of selected item   | Prompts for new `@type` name       |
| `n`     | Add new todo                             | Adds item to current group/context |
| `A`     | Archive completed todos                  | Appends to `todo.archive.txt`      |

`A` clears the todo file of completed todos and appends them in a file called `todo.archive.txt` in the same directory as the original file. This file is created if it does not exist. (This follows the way _Markor_ does it.)

### üîÉ Sorting & Grouping

| Key | Action                         | Notes                                  |
| --- | ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| `p` | Sort by priority (A ‚Üí Z)       | Empty priority appears last            |
| `P` | Sort by priority (Z ‚Üí A)       |                                        |
| `d` | Sort by date (oldest first)    | Uses `YYYY-MM-DD` format               |
| `D` | Sort by date (newest first)    |                                        |
| `g` | Group by uncompleted/completed | Keeps current sort order within groups |
| `G` | Restore original file order    | Discards sort/grouping changes         |

### üõ† Miscellaneous

| Key | Action            | Notes                     |
| --- | ----------------- | ------------------------- |
| `?` | Show help overlay | Press any key to close it |
| `q` | Quit              | Exits the viewer          |

## The virtual category `@all`

The **all** category is a virtual context that displays all todos across all @types. It supports full operations, including navigation, sorting, grouping, adding new items, toggling completion, and setting priorities, just like real categories.

Adding a new todo while in the `@all` context will mark it with the actual type `@all`. A todo entry without any `@type` set will be treated as `@all` by default.

## `--exec` Hook

You can optionally pass a script to be executed when todos are **added** or **toggled un/completed**. This is done using the `--exec` command-line argument:

```
nntm todo.txt --exec /path/to/script.sh
```

### Behavior:

- When a todo is **added**, the script is invoked with the following as argument:

  ```
  Added: <text>
  ```

- When a todo is **marked as completed**, the script is invoked the following as argument with:

  ```
  Completed: <text>
  ```

### Requirements:

- The script must be executable.
- It must accept a **single argument** (the prefixed todo text).
- The viewer does **not wait** for the script to finish (non-blocking, runs in a forked child).

### Example:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# /home/f/hooks/notify.sh

echo "Triggered: $1" >> ~/.nntm_log
```

Then run:

```bash
nntm todo.txt --exec /home/f/hooks/notify.sh
```

This enables integration with external tools like notifications, logging, syncing, or webhooks.

## Limitations

- _Markor_ todo files have context (`@`) and project (`+`). The latter is not implemented here.

## Todo

- Cmd arg for specifying archive file.
- Ability to edit a todo (with prompt and with custom editor).
- Maybe a daemon mode, but for my own needs, I'm able to keep the initial instance running.
- Ability to set title bar text displayed in UI by cmd arg.

## Trivia

Mostly generated by AI with a lot of tweaking. It was generated step by step, adding one feature after another in isolation. I sort of know my way around C and this gave me some memories, but I just do not remember the syntax and many of the details. This took me half a day, and I expanded with more features than I initially intended.
